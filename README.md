# Aruco Marker-Based Surgical Tool Navigation System

This project simulates a surgical tool navigation system using Aruco markers and OpenCV to track a tool in real-time. The system provides augmented reality (AR) visual feedback, including distance measurements and directional arrows, to guide the tool toward a target marker. The mobile phone camera is used as the webcam via **DroidCam** for capturing the video feed.

## Introduction

This project tracks two Aruco markers: one attached to a simulated tool and another placed on a target surface. It uses **DroidCam** to turn a mobile phone into a webcam, allowing the system to track the toolâ€™s movement in real time and provide AR feedback on the screen.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of tool and target Aruco markers using a mobile phone camera via DroidCam.
- AR visual feedback to assist navigation:
  - Distance indicator between tool and target.
  - Directional arrow guiding the tool towards the target.
- Augmented reality (AR) overlay using OpenCV.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV with Aruco module
- Numpy
- **DroidCam** (for mobile phone as webcam)
